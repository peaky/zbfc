????: What did you dream of last night?

??: nothing

????: is that it?

??: well, imagine a world where physics is explained by you. And mind you this is the not the mind of physicist, it is the mind of a kid. Houses can transport you anywhere in the world, parking is no longer an issue, skyscrapers bend over backwards to accommodate you, the world spins backwards...

????: that sounds a little better than nothing

??: yah, it is

????: so which do you choose to create? nothing? Or the a world where physics is explained by you?

??: [insert your answer here]


THE MESSAGE

IN THIS WORLD PEOPLE MAY TRY TO TELL YOU OTHERWISE, BUT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. AT THIS POINT I IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE COMING UP WITH QUITE A FEW COUNTER EXAMPLES, BUT REALLY IT'S TRUE! REALITY MIGHT NOT ALLOW YOU TO CREATE A DIRECT COPY OF ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE (ALTHOUGH IT CAN GET PRETTY CLOSE), BUT NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, IT IS STILL POSSIBLE, BUT MAYBE IN A WAY THAT YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT. THE CONVERSATION ABOVE IS LITTERED WITH IRONY (ON SOCIETY PERSPECTIVE) BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS WORLD IS, IRONIC.

SO I'LL SAY IT ONCE MORE: WHAT DID YOU DREAM OF LAST NIGHT?
